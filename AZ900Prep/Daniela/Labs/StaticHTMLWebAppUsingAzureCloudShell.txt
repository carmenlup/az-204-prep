1. In this exercise, you'll deploy a basic HTML+CSS site to Azure App Service by using the Azure CLI az webapp up command. 
	You'll then update the code and redeploy it by using the same command.

	The az webapp up command makes it easy to create and update web apps. When executed it performs the following actions:

		Create a default resource group if one isn't specified.
		Create a default app service plan.
		Create an app with the specified name.
		Zip deploy files from the current working directory to the web app.

2. Open Bash => Create a directory and then navigate to it: 
		mkdir htmlapp
		cd htmlapp

3. Run the following git command to clone the sample app repository to your htmlapp directory
	git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/html-docs-hello-world.git

4. Set variables to hold the resource group and app names by running the following commands.
	resourceGroup=$(az group list --query "[].{id:name}" -o tsv)
	appName=az204app$RANDOM
  
  5. Create the web app. Change to the directory that contains the sample code and run the az webapp up command.
	  cd html-docs-hello-world
	 az webapp up -g $resourceGroup -n $appName --html

This command may take a few minutes to run. While running, it displays information similar to the example below.

{
"app_url": "https://<myAppName>.azurewebsites.net",
"location": "westeurope",
"name": "<app_name>",
"os": "Windows",
"resourcegroup": "<resource_group_name>",
"serverfarm": "appsvc_asp_Windows_westeurope",
"sku": "FREE",
