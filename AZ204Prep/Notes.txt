- How to enable Publish from VS
	- go to the Webb App - Settings - Configuration - Enable SCM Basic Auth Publishing Credentials

- App Service plan
	Shared:
		Free: 60 minutes of compute per day
		Shared
	Dedicaed:
		Basic
		Standard
		Premium
		Premium V2
		Premium V3
	Isolated
		Isolated
		Isolated V2

	SQL server and DB
		- set server firewall in order to allow connections

	Using TLS

	How to use custom domain names and certificates
		1. Upgrade service plan to minimum Basic
		2. Go to the web app - Custom Domains 
			- from there you copy the so called Records (some info that will help Azure to validate the domain) and add them onto the external provider platform (dns records)
			- click Validate & Add

	Service plan
		- Free & Shared: you share the VMs. Limited computing time
		- Basic and Higher: dedicated VMs, no limitation in term of computing time

	Auto Scaling
		- With standard you can scale based on Rules
			- Azure monitor will check your resources and monitor some metrics 
			- Set min - max instances
			- Add scale rules
			- The monitored metrics is for the entire app service infrastructure (NOT for a single VM). 

		- With premium you can have automatic scaling based on traffic 

	Deployment Slots
		- From Standard service plan or higher
		- When creating configuration settings that should be available only for that specific deployment slot (not swapable), you need to check Deployment Slot Setting
	
	Azure app service Logging 
		- From Web app level - Application Service Logs
		- Enable/Disable: 
			Application Logs (saved to File sistem or Blob) / 
			Web Server Logging (File sistem or Storage. You can specify retention days) / 
			Detailed error message / 
			Failed request tracing
		- you can connect to the log stream and view the live logs (how show how to do that from VS Code)
